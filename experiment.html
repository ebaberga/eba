THE NATURE OF SCIENCE ABD PHYSICS 
•	The concern of describing observable facts in nature essentially defines the realm of physics.
•	Physics quantity is anything that can be measured or calculated.
For example: - velocity= distance /time 
Distance and time are measureable factors, and velocity is the calculated.


	

           Common prefixes and scientific notation   
•	Scientific notation: is a method of writing repeated zero in the form of 10 the power of positive integer. “b x 10 postive integer”  the value of “b” should be between 0 and 10. Eg: 160000m= 1.6 x 105 m
•	Prefixes: are names given for a specific value of 10postive integer. Eg: 1018=exa  if it is a distance then 1018 will be examerter. 
    




                                                      MODEL, LAW, PRINCPLE AND LAW 
•	Laws: are rules that govern our universe. Laws in nature already exist. No human can create them, but they can discover these laws. Eg: Newton’s law of motion, Gas law etc………….
•	Theories: are generalized explanation of nature that are supported by evidence and are approved after numerous trails.
•	Models: is a presentation of something which can’t be directly displayed directly. Eg: Dalton’s atomic model(billiard ball model)                             Atom    
This model was passed because atoms can’t be displayed directly.
    


                                                         Accuracy, Precision and Uncertainty 
•	Accuracy: measures how close the number is to the correct value. 
•	Precision: measures how close the repeatedly measured values are.
•	Uncertainty: measures the inaccuracy of the measurement
Eg: Given                              required                                                 solution
      S= 10±0.2m                      v=?                                                          v= S/t
      T= 2±0.4 sec                                                                                    v= 10/2=5 m/s
   Uncertainty = 0.2 x 100%÷10 + 0.4 x 100% ÷ 2= 22%(0.22)   v= 5±0.22m/s
